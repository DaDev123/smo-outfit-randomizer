# mk8d-randomizer

This project came about because there is no random loadout generation built into
MK8D, and me and my friends too often play with the exact same setups. It's also 
a good excuse to learn new things. 

## Features I may add in the future:

- Web interface
- Map randomization (with blacklists)
- Item randomization
