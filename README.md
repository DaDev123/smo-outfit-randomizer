# mk8d-randomizer

This project came about because there is no random loadout generation built into
MK8D, and me and my friends too often play with the exact same setups. It's also 
a good excuse to learn new things. 

You can use the app in the browser [here](https://ryankopp.github.io/mk8d-randomizer/)

Or you can build and run it natively with `cargo run`

Built using the [eframe_template](https://github.com/emilk/eframe_template).
While eframe was great to work with, I think immediate mode rendering doesn't 
suit the project very well, so I may switch to a different framework or use
wasm-bindgen on it's own with a javascript framework before adding anything new. 

## Features I may add in the future:

- Blacklists for map randomization
- Item randomization
- Images 
- Dark Mode
