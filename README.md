# mk8d-randomizer

This project came about because there is no random loadout generation built into MK8D, and me and my friends too often play with the exact same setups. It's also a good excuse to learn new things. 

You can use the app in the browser [here](https://ryankopp.github.io/mk8d-randomizer/).

Built using the [dioxus](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus).
Still don't really understand React, but it was pretty slick, and tailwind is great.  

## Features I may add in the future:

- Blacklists for map randomization
- Item randomization
- Images
